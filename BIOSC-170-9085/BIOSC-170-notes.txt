#What is environmental science?

-How the natural world works, how the environment affects us, and vice versa.

#What does the natural world include?

-Environment: Abiotic and biotic things. All living and non-living things around us in ecosystems.
-Society: Humans and our living spaces, and our social relationships.

-Natural Resources: An energy source we take from environment.
-Renewable vs non-renewable

-Inexhaustible renewable natural resources

#Agricultural Revolution
-10,000 yrs ago

#Industrial Revolution
-mid-1700's to early 1900's

Population grows --> requires more development --> leads to problems

We take, it comes back. "What goes around comes around"

**The Lesson of Easter Island**
The island used to be rich of life and species. What happened was deforestation led to loss of natural resources, soil erosion, no canoes for fishing, revolt, war among classes, and decline of society.

"WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO DEPLETE OUR NON-RENEWABLE RESOURCES"

BOOK: Collapse by Jared Diamond (2005) about the collpase of societies

#Levels of Scale
1. Organism
2. Population
3. Community
4. Ecosystem
5. Landscape
6. Biosphere

Energy flows, matter is recycled.

#Biogeochemical cycles
-Matter cycles within ecosystems from one organism to another.
-Energy floes in one direction THROUGH an ecosystem. 
-Producer --> Consumers
-Energy enters a system as sunlight and exits as heat.

#The water cycle

#Sources and sinks

RESIDENCE TIME: How long a nutrient/material remains in a reservoir
FLUX: the rate at which materials move between reservoirs

https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/carbon-sources-and-sinks/

EUTROPHICATION: excessive richness of nutrients in a lake or other body of water, frequently due to runoff from the land, which causes a dense growth of plant life and death of animal life from lack of oxygen.

#Energy flow in ecosystems
-All living organisms require energy to survive and function.
-Organisms get their energy for life either by:
	-Autotophs: Getting energy from an abiotic source and making their own food with that energy
	-Heterotrophs: Getting energy/food from consuming other organisms

#PHOTOSYNTHESIS FOLMULA
Sunlight, carbon dioxide, water --> oxygen, glucose
6CO2 + 6H20 + light energy >>> c6h12O6 + 6O2

-Two types of autotrophs:
	-Photoautotrophs: do photosynthesis to make their own food from the sun's Energy
	-chemoautotrophs: do chemosynthesis to make their own food using energy from chemicals

-All living things do some type of respiration --> cells harvest E from chemical bonds by breaking down organic molecules (eg. sugar) into simpler molecules and extracting the stored energy
-Living things access this stored E by breaking these bonds during cellular respiration

#AEROBIC RESPIRATION
C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6O2 --> 6CO2 + 6H2O + ENERGY

-energy comes to our planet from the sun
-is converted into chemical bond energy by photosynthetic organisms
-is accessed for use by organisms through aerobic or anaerobic respiration
-all life is linked in food chains and webs -
TROPHIC INTERACTIONS: feeding relationships between organisms

FOOD WEB DIAGRAMS: Trophic interactions can be highly complex, making them difficult to work with

FOOD CHAINS: simplified food webs, a sequence of organisms that food on each other
-many food chains create food webs

DECOMPOSERS: feed on dead producers and consumers
	-are necessary for the renewal of life because they recycle nutrients and 			biological molecules making them available to be used again by producers

DECOMPOSERS: turn food chain into food cycle
FOOD PYRAMID: show biomass of organisms in each level of the food chain

==================================================

PRACTICE QUESTION 1: Sevengill sharks are one of 
our local shark species in coastal California. 
If a sevengill shark that is a tertiary predator 
weighs 150 lbs, how many lbs of primary producers 
must support it?

3rd consumer | shark 150lbs
2nd consumer | 150 x 10 = 1,500 lbs
1st consumer | 1,500 x 10 = 15,000 lbs
1st producer | 15,000 x 10 = 150,000 lbs

Answer: 150,000 lbs of primary producer needed to support it.

===================================================

QUESTION 2: Ospreys are one of our most 
important fish-eating birds of prey. An 
average osprey weighs 3 lbs.  Based 
on the food pyramid to the left, how 
many osprey would be supported by 
60,000 lbs of algae and phytoplankton?

Inverted pyramid (divide up the chain):

60,000 / 10 = 6,000
6,000 / 10 = 600
600 / 10 = 60
60 / 10 = 6
6 / 3 = 2 

Answer: 2 osprey would be supported.

===================================================

-Food webs allow us to trace the 
movement of materials through 
ecosystems and understand their 
biomagnification in organis

#DDT case study

BIOACCUMULATION: refers to the accumulation chemicals in an organism & occurs when an organism absorbs a toxic substance at a rate greater than that at which the substance is lost.

BIOMAGNIFICATION:S the increasing concentration of a substance, such as a toxic chemical, in the tissues of organisms at successively higher livels in a food chain

Accumulate the chemical, it magnifies up the food chain.

Meeting 3 - Feb. 7 | Population Ecology
******************

Population Density = # of individuals / unit area

Population distribution (dispersion): nspacial arangement of organisms in an area
	1. Clumped
	2. Uniform
	3. Random

HOW DO POPULATIONS CHANGE IN SIZE?

Determined by four factors:
	1. Natality: births in a population
	2. Mortality: death in a population
	3. Immigration: arrival of new individuals from outside a population
	4. Emigration: Departure of individuals from the population

	RATE OF INCREASE = (birth rate) - (death rate)

	r = (b - d) + (i - e)

	r is pos. = pop. increase
	r is neg. = pop decrease
	r is zero = pop is stationary

Population is still increasing, but rate of change is decreasing. 

Low and High Biotic potential
